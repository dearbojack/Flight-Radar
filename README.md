# Global Gazette
Group project

## Description
This application is deployed on the following link:
- https://dearbojack.github.io/Global-Gazette/

This application is a news website that gets news from The New York Times API and serves it back to the user depending on what country the user searched for. There's no particular reason for choosing this news source for this application other than the API being free to use.

The application also returns the weather status for the capital city for the country the user searched for.

In addition the application returns basic statistics about the country the user searched for along with the corresponding country flag.

Other features of this application:
- The user has the ability to set a home location where if the user reloads the page or even closes the page the set country will populate the API results
- The user can click on the news title to redirect to that particular article on the The New York Times website 
- There is a button called "Random Country" that will populate API results for a random country

## Installation
There are no prerequisites required to run this application on a modern web browser.

## Usage
The application is responsive, therefore, it can be used on a range of devices.

At the time of publishing this application, the three API's that populate results are free to use. As it's built with the free plan, too many requests within a short time could temporarily produce no results on the application.
